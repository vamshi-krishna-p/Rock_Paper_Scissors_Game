# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game
Object Oriented Python Game

The game have four computer player strategies:

1. A player that chooses its moves randomly - 'Player()'
2. A player that remembers and imitates what the human player did in the previous round - 'ReflectPlayer()'
3. A player that cycles through the three moves - 'CyclePlayer()'
4. A player that always plays 'rock' - 'ConstantPlayer()'

The Game class include a method to play a single round - "game.play_game_once()", 
and a method to play a match of several rounds - "game.play_game()".

Combine 'computer player strategies' with either 'game.play_game()' or 'game.play_game_once()' for different game scenarios.
